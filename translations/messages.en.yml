about:
    title: Radio Il Est écrit 92.4fm-Yaoundé Cameroun.
    part1: Listen and live !
    part2: Dear listeners, Welcome to your radio in its online version!
    part3: We chose to serve God. And since 1963, when we only did thirty-minute radio shows "Il Est Ecrit", God used every second to extend his calls for grace. Hundreds of thousands of souls have been torn out of the kingdom of darkness. In 2003, the dream of a broadcasting station has opened the way to the effective launch of our emissions in Yaounde on 92.4 FM, but the official launch will occur only December 9, 2005.
    part4: Our team of volunteers gives their heart and soul for the salvation of our fellow men. Our musical choice and our biblical and christocentric messages aim to give life to all our tired and tired listeners.
    part5: What happiness for us to know that listening to a melody, a word, the suicidal impulses of a desperate girl yield to the invigorating rays of God! They were on the verge of breaking up in their marriage and a message about the love flame was put back in place. Increasingly extraordinary testimonies mark our daily activities. They make me more humble. And I actually recognize that God is at work, and we are only instruments. To know that a simple prayer of faith disrupts the forces of hell can only comfort us in our ministry.
    part6: Faced with an increasingly pressing demand to capture our signal everywhere, we have chosen to extend the signal through the canvas. We pray that God will use our ministry as much, if not more, to free the captives, to set the oppressed free and to give hope to those who believe they have lost everything. Are you lost and prey to sin today? Jesus can free you! Are you far from God and trapped in hatred and bitterness? Jesus can free you! If you listened and were blessed, invite others around you to do so. You can also support the ministry of radio "Il Est Ecrit" by your donations and voluntary offerings.
    part7: Listen and live! This is our slogan
